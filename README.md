The winter break was a bit cold this year which scuttled my holiday skiing plans. The frigid temperatures felt like living in an icebox. So instead of skiing, I packaged up my family and transported them to [San Antonio Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio) to attend [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com) a very large gaming convention. We spent most of our time playing tabletop games, though there was a fair amount of video game action going on. I re-learned how to play [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and acquired a few decks inclduing pre-release cards that were special for the event.

This winter I worked a lot. And I slept a lot. I wish I could have slept more. When I graduate, I am going to dedicate an entire year to sleeping. Man, I love sleep. Work is fun, too.

This winter break I spent my 28th birthday at Sugarloaf with my family.  We attempted to ski and snowboard, but damn it was cold.  We only lasted about 3-4 runs each day we were there.  Luckily the place we were staying at had a massive wood stove which got things cooking quickly.  Towards the end of break I went to Winter Park, CO for a week of fantastic skiing.  I would highly recommend Winter Park resort if you're a skiier.
