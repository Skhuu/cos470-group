The winter break was a bit cold this year which scuttled my holiday skiing plans. The frigid temperatures felt like living in an icebox. So instead of skiing, I packaged up my family and transported them to [San Antonio Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio) to attend [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com) a very large gaming convention. We spent most of our time playing tabletop games, though there was a fair amount of video game action going on. I re-learned how to play [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and acquired a few decks including pre-release cards that were special for the event.

Sledding highlighted my winter break. My youngest daughter and I, during 
the cold snap, just after a nice powdery snow fall decided that sledding 
was a necessity. After testing the waters at Reiche playground and getting 
board with the short runs, we head for a bigger hill, the Western Prom.
Not sure if you have been out there but the hill is so steep it forces 
the walking paths to have several switchbacks. We assume the usual 
positions, with my daughter in my lap and my legs out to the side 
for steering. After a slow long run along the upper path my daughter 
looks down the hill and affirms that we will be going down the 
steep part next. As we turn down towards Valley Street our speed 
picks up with vigor and power blinds the driver. We hit the
first path below us with a thud and the sled comes to an abrupt stop.
With a laugh we start up the hill again for a second run. This time 
we make it past the first path and gain even more speed and crash hard 
into the bank after the second path. My daughter went flying into the bank, 
we broke the sled and I braced myself for the worst. I knew all was well when 
my daughter springs up and said, "That was awesome. It's ok daddy we can 
always get a new sled, but that was the best sled ride ever!"
