The winter break was a bit cold this year which scuttled my holiday skiing plans. The frigid temperatures felt like living in an icebox. So instead of skiing, I packaged up my family and transported them to [San Antonio Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio) to attend [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com) a very large gaming convention. We spent most of our time playing tabletop games, though there was a fair amount of video game action going on. I re-learned how to play [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and acquired a few decks inclduing pre-release cards that were special for the event.

This winter I worked a lot. And I slept a lot. I wish I could have slept more. When I graduate, I am going to dedicate an entire year to sleeping. Man, I love sleep. Work is fun, too.

During winter break this year I really did not do much. I went to all of my family's Christmas parties and went home for Christmas. I also tried to go running pretty much everyday even though it was ridiculously cold outside most days. Other than that I basically just played Fortnite and watched Netflix.
